- 👋 Hi, I’m Nikoló Meloni, I'm an italian guy :D  (@ilMellon)
- 👀 I’m interested in video games and learning how to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++ rn are my priorities
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything, litteraly everything, if i can learn from ppl who know more than me, I'm in 100%
- 📫 How to reach me, here on github, on discord (watermellon_)
- 🥨 Some things about me: I'm a Fluffy guy, and I go to the  gym 3 times a week, I like drawing and dogs, but I don't have a dog unluckly :(
- 🥞 As a fluffy guy I can cook, and I think I'm not bad at it :D, my favourite dish is "lasagna" or "pasticcio" if you know what I mean.
- Peace out <3 ✌
